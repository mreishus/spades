## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] - 2020-01-20

### Changed

- Dependency upgrades

## [0.3.1] - 2020-01-09

### Changed

- Moved chat layouts to be side-by-side with the game and lobby.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-11-22

### Added

- Bots learned how to bid by looking at their hands.
- Bots learned how to pick cards with some logic instead of randomly. They
  don't play perfectly, but they play "good enough" and are aware of nils.
  Note that they don't try to avoid bags.

## [0.2.1] - 2019-11-19

### Added

- Chat windows in the lobby and game rooms. Overall page layout needs to be
  improved, though.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-11-18

### Added

- Dumb bots to play against. They will always bid 3 and play random cards.

## [0.1.1] - 2019-11-17

### Fixed

- Fixed idle rooms not automatically deleting.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-11-16

Initial release. Rough, but playable with 4 people.
