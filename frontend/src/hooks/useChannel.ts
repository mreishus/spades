import { useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";

/* useChannel is used to provide access to phoenix channels.

example usage showing communication in both directions:

interface Props {}
export const TestComponent: React.FC<Props> = () => {
  const onChannelMessage = useCallback((event, payload) => {
    console.log("Got channel message from phoenix", event, payload);
  }, []);
  const broadcast = useChannel("lobby:lobby", onChannelMessage);
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => broadcast("test_message_from_javascript", { stuff: 1 })}
    >
      Send message to phoenix
    </button>
  );
};

this is adapated from alexgriff/use-phoenix-channel with the following changes:
1. Ported to typescript
2. Does not force you to use a reducer.

Note: It does require access to a phoenix socket object, built like so:

import { Socket } from 'phoenix';
const socket = new Socket(webSocketUrl, {params: options});
socket.connect();

It looks for this in SocketContext.  See
https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/improving-ux-with-phoenix-channels-react-hooks-8e661d3a771e
for an example implementation.
